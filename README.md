For this challenge, you need to predict bacteria species based on repeated lossy measurements of DNA snippets. Snippets of length 10 are analyzed using Raman spectroscopy that calculates the histogram of bases in the snippet.

Each row of data contains a spectrum of histograms generated by repeated measurements of a sample, each row containing the output of all 286 histogram possibilities.
